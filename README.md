## 👨‍💻 About Me 

Hi, I'm **Mallik Vinukonda**, a passionate Computer Science student with a deep interest in technology and its real-world impact. Growing up with a father who is a dedicated lawyer, I witnessed firsthand the challenges and opportunities in the legal field. Inspired by his work and driven by my love for coding, I created this AI-powered legal assistant to make legal information more accessible to everyone in India.

This project blends my technical skills and personal experiences to help bridge the gap between law and technology for the benefit of all.
